'	MonitorControlAFDX.txt : COPILOT SCRIPT EXAMPLE
'
'	Copyright 2009 Ballard Technology, Inc.
'       
'	This Monitor Control sample script controls the pause state of a
' 	sequential record object (Mon1). The monitor object in the hardware
' 	tree must be active and configured to monitor data (i.e. "All").
'
'	The recording state of the monitor is in turn controlled by Field1.
' 	When the data value of Field1 is Below the UPPERLIMIT the monitor
' 	is un-paused. When above UPPERLIMIT, recording is paused. Changing
' 	data values in Field1 trigger a change in the recording state of
' 	the monitor.
'
'	Application:	Record all bus traffic when a field is between a certain range -
'                       this could be during takeoff and landing or another condition where
' 			the field value is less than UPPERLIMIT.
'
'	Notes:		MIL-STD-1553 fields or ARINC 429 labels/fields can also be used in
'                       place of the "Field1" object.
'
'	Databuses:	AFDX/ARINC 664 (or MIL-STD-1553, ARINC 429)
