'	InputOutputControl.txt : COPILOT SCRIPT EXAMPLE
'
'	Copyright 2004 Ballard Technology, Inc.
'       
'	This example shows an input box to get user input and then shows a 
'	message box displaying the text that was entered.
'
'	Required objects:
'	 A InOutCtrl must be inserted in a control view and then that control must
'	 be inserted into the script view with the name of 'InOutCtrl1'
'
'	Notes: The MsgBox and InputBox built into scripting should NOT be used. 
'	 MsgBox and InputBox stop the script processing (and slows or stops other 
'	 user interface) until the dialog is finished. This control can be used to 
'	 circumvent this problem.
'
'	Databuses:	ALL
'

Dim MyInput

Sub ScriptStart
	View.OutputLine ("Hello World")
	
	Call InOutCtrl1.ShowInputBox("Type some text:","Input Box Title")
End Sub

Sub ScriptStop
End Sub

'Event Handler for Ok button of the InOut Control
Sub InOutCtrl1_Ok()
	'TODO: Enter code here
	
	MyInput = InOutCtrl1.InputText

	'Since the OK event handeler is calling a method that will fire the OK event,
	'the string is being checked for input... to avoid an infinite loop
	If Len(MyInput) Then
		MessageString = "The text that was entered: " + vbNewLine + MyInput
		Call InOutCtrl1.ShowMessageBox(MessageString,"Message Box Title",0)
		
		'Must clear the value here or infinite loop will result!
		InOutCtrl1.InputText = ""
	end if
End Sub
