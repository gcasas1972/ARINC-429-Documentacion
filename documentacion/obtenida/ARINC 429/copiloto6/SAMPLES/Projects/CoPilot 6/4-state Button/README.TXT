4-StateButton

Notes:
This project was updated for use with CoPilot 5.30 or later.

Description:
This project is a sample that should illustrate the concepts of linking
between the control view and an intermediate and/or inactive object and
the use of scripting. The basic operation connects the output state of 
the control linked to a field. 

Operation:
When the field value changes the script handels the event which in turn
sets the actual desired state (the second field). The text display of 
the states are defined in the second field. The green background colors
of the button were made slightly different to show the state changing.
