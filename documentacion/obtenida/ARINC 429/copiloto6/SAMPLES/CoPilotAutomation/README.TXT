    INTRODUCTION

          CoPilot is built using the Component Object Model (COM)
          technology known as Automation (formerly called OLE
          Automation). Automation allows a developer to create an
          application that uses CoPilot as a component (controls 
          the CoPilot application with the other program). 
          
          Several examples are included on this CD. Including 
          examples written in C, VB and VBScript. However CoPilot
          automation is available using any programming language 
          that supports COM.

          

     CORRECTIONS, WARNINGS, AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

          This example was updated and tested with CoPilot version 5.15.
