     INTRODUCTION

          The program COPILOT PROJECT EXPLORER is a 32-bit program 
          developed by Ballard Technology Inc. to demonstrate
          the basics of using CoPilot as an Automation server.
          This example client program is intended to demonstate 
          the following CoPilot Automation concepts/tasks:
            - Connect to an instance of the CoPilot Application
              If CoPilot is not running, a new instance will be created
            - Retreive current project information (such as running state,
              number of cards, number of views, visible state)
            - Show/Hide the CoPilot application
          If the project changes or a different project is loaded, the
          information in this application will be updated when the
          'REFRESH' button is pressed.

     CORRECTIONS, WARNINGS, AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
