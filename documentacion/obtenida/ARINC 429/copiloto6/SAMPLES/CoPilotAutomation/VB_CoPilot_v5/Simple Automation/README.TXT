     INTRODUCTION

          The program SIMPLE AUTOMATION is a 32-bit program 
          developed by Ballard Technology Inc. to demonstrate
          the basics of using CoPilot as an Automation server.
          This example client program is intended to demonstate 
          the following CoPilot Automation concepts/tasks:
            - Connect to an instance of the CoPilot Application
              If CoPilot is not running, a new instance will be created
            - Find a specific data item in the project (either a 
              1553 field or 429 label)
            - Minimal code needed to use CoPilot's OLE automation feature


     CORRECTIONS, WARNINGS, AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

          This example was updated and tested with CoPilot version 5.15.
