     INTRODUCTION

          CoPilot is a 32-bit Windows-based software
          application that simplifies the simulation and
          testing of ARINC 429, MIL-STD-1553, ARINC 708, ARINC 
          717 and AFDX databuses.  This application provides a
          consistent graphical interface to Ballard's family
          of databus interface products, including PCI,
          PCMCIA, cPCI, USB, PMC, and Ethernet products.

          In order to work with one of Ballard interface
          products, the board or box must be keyed.  When
          CoPilot is purchased, the software license is
          associated with a particular product model and serial
          number.

          The key may be installed at the factory, or by the
          customer remotely with the assistance of a Ballard
          customer support engineer.

          CoPilot operates Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows
          Vista, Windows 7 and above.



     INSTALLING UNDER WINDOWS 2000, XP, VISTA, AND WINDOWS 7

          To install CoPilot under Windows 2000, Windows XP, 
          Windows Vista, or Windows 7, the following steps must
          be performed.

               1. Install the hardware into the computer
               2. Install the drivers for the hardware
               3. Install the CoPilot software

          To install the hardware, refer to the Installation
          section of the User's Manual that accompanies the
          hardware.
          
          Since these verstions of Windows operating system are
          "plug-and-play", the new hardware will be detected
          and a dialog box will prompt for a driver disk. 
          Specify the [X:\DRIVER] folder on the CoPilot CD to
          complete the installation process.

          To install the CoPilot software, insert the CoPilot
          CD into the CD-ROM drive.  If it automatically runs
          a program, then all you need to do is click
          "Install CoPilot" and follow the instructions.  If
          you need to manually install it, run the program
          INSTALL.EXE in the [X:\INSTALL] folder.

          CoPilot 5 may also be installed with CoPilot 6,
          concurrently. This may be done by clicking the
          "Installation Options" link in the installer and
          checking "Also Install CoPilot 5." Note that if an old
          version of CoPilot 5 is detected on your system, the
          installer will prompt to update CoPilot 5 automatically.
          Switching between running CoPilot 5 and 6 installations
          requires Administrator rights on the computer.
