     INTRODUCTION

          The Avionics BusBox is an ethernet device that
          allows the user to communicate with multiple
          avionics databuses.  These avionics databus
          interfaces include MIL-STD-1553, ARINC 429, ARINC
          717, ARINC 708, RS-422, CSDB, and Discrete IO.  The
          folders listed above contain the drivers,
          libraries, and examples for using the Avionics
          BusBox product in a user application.

          Please perform the following steps.

          1.  Go to the <DRIVERS> folder and run the
              installation program SETUP.EXE.  The program
              will install the driver files appropriate for
              your operating system, and install BTITST32.EXE
              to test the hardware.

          2.  Run BTITST32.EXE from the desktop icon to test
              the installation of the Avionics BusBox in your
              computer.

          3.  Go to the <API> folder to copy the headers and
              libraries for writing applications to operate
              the Avionics BusBox, and the example programs
              that exercise the various features of the
              Avionics BusBox.
