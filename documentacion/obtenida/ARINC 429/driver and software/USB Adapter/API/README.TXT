     INTRODUCTION

          The BTIDriver API provides the user with functions
          to communicate with multiple avionics databuses.
          These avionics databus interfaces include
          MIL-STD-1553, ARINC 429, ARINC 717, ARINC 708,
          RS-422, CSDB, and Discrete IO.  The folders listed
          above contain the include files, libraries, and
          examples for operating the various protocols on
          BTIDriver-compliant devices.

          For multi-protocol devices, simply combine the
          concepts from the included example programs to
          build your own custom application.
