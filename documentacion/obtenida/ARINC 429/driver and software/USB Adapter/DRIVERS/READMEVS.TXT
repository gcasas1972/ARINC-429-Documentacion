     INTRODUCTION

          This file describes how to install the driver files needed
          for operating the USB Adapter from a host computer.



     AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION

          The USB Adapter is a plug-and-play device.  The
          first time the USB adapter is plugged into a USB slot,
          the card is detected and the driver installation process
          begins automatically.

          When prompted to install the drivers, follow these
          steps:

          1.  Select the 'Locate and install driver software'
              option.

          2.  Insert the media containing the USB Adapter
              installation files into the floppy or CD-ROM
              drive and click 'Next'.  It will begin
              searching for the drivers.

          3.  Select 'Install' to approve installation
              of the driver.

          4.  Wait for the wizard to copy the files.  Click
              'Close' when the installation is complete.

          Please refer to the README.TXT file in the <TEST>
          folder of the LX1553-5 distribution media for
          information on testing the installation and
          assigning card numbers.
