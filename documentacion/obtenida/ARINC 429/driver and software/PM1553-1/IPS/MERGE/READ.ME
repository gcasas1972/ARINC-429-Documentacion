
mergerom: merges 2 Intel-Hex format files for use in programming PROMS
	  for the SuMMIT-XT which uses a single 8-bit PROM for `autoinit'.

Specifically, mergerom will merge the Intel-Hex files created by the
Interactive Programming System (IPS) or any other Intel-Hex files which
follow the same older, simpler format. Mergerom will not merge some of
the newer Intel-Hex formats which use the extended addressing schemes. If
this capability is required please contact your UTMC Field Applications
Engineer.

To get a usage line from `mergerom' type: mergerom -z

usage: mergerom [-l lscfile] [-m mscfile] [-v]
        -l lscfile      specify the least significant byte file to merge
        -m mscfile      specify the most significant byte file to merge
        -v      Print version number and exit

If no arguments or only one argument is specified on the command line then
mergerom will prompt the user for the lsc and/or msc file name(s). The lsc
file name is used to derive the name of the output file which is given a
``.xt'' file extension. For example, ``mergerom -l my.lsc -m your.msc'', 
will create a merged Intel-Hex file under the name ``my.xt''.
