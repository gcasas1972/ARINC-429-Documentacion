     INTRODUCTION

          The PM1553-1 is a PC/104-compliant interface card
          capable of communicating over MIL-STD-1553 avionics
          databuses.  Embedded systems frequently use PC/104
          products because they are small (about four inches
          square), inexpensive, and easily integrated into an
          application.  The folders listed above contain the
          libraries and examples for using the PM1553-1 from
          a user application.

          Go to the <DOS>, <WINDOWS>, or <WINDOWS CE> folder
          appropriate for your operating system and refer to
          the README.TXT for information on how to use the
          PM1553-1 for that particular operating system.

          Go to the <DOC> folder to read the SuMMIT Handbook.
          The Adobe Acrobat Reader software is required to
          read the documentation.



     CORRECTIONS, WARNINGS, AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
