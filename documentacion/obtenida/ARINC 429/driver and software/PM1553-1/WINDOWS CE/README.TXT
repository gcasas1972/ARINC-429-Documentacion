     INTRODUCTION

          The PM1553-1 is a PC/104-compliant interface card
          capable of communicating over MIL-STD-1553 avionics
          databuses.  Embedded systems frequently use PC/104
          products because they are small (about four inches
          square), inexpensive, and easily integrated into an
          application.  The folders listed above contain the
          source for the driver and examples for using the
          PM1553-1 from a user application running under
          Windows CE 5.0.



     BUILDING THE DRIVER AND EXAMPLES

	      Each of the folders listed above contains a
	      Platform Builder project.  Insert the BTIISA device
	      driver project into your OS Design to include the
	      driver.  Insert one or more of the examples to
