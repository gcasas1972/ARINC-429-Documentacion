     INTRODUCTION

          The BTI_P13.LLB is a LabVIEW library that allows
          LabVIEW applications to operate the PC1553-3
          MIL-STD-1553 ISA interface card.  It adds the
          PC1553-3 API functions to the LabVIEW function
          panel under the Instruments Library.  Several
          examples are included in the library file.  If they
          are modified, care should be taken to copy the
          examples to a separate VI file or library prior to
          making the changes.
