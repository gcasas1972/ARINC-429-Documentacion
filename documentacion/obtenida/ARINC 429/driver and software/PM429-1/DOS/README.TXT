     INTRODUCTION

          The PM429-1 is a PC/104-compliant interface card
          capable of communicating over ARINC 429 avionics
          databuses. Embedded systems frequently use PC/104
          products because they are small (about four inches
          square), inexpensive, and easily integrated into an
          application. In addition to the ARINC 429 capability,
          the PM429-1 provides a general-purpose timer and
          optional input and output discretes.

          The folders listed above contain the drivers,
          libraries, and examples for using the PM429-1 from
          a user application running under DOS.



     CORRECTIONS, WARNINGS, AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
