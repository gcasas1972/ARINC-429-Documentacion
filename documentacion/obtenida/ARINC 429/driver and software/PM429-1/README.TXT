     INTRODUCTION

          The PM429-1 is a PC/104-compliant interface card
          capable of communicating over ARINC 429 avionics
          databuses. Embedded systems frequently use PC/104
          products because they are small (about four inches
          square), inexpensive, and easily integrated into an
          application. In addition to the ARINC 429 capability,
          the PM429-1 provides a general-purpose timer and
          optional input and output discretes.

          Go to the <DOS>, <WINDOWS>, or <WINDOWS CE> folder
          appropriate for your operating system and refer to
          the README.TXT for information on how to use the
          PM429-1 for that particular operating system.
