     INTRODUCTION

          The program BTITST32 is a 32-bit graphical program
          and BTITST64 is a 64-bit graphical program that
          tests the installation of Ballard's BTIDriver
          compliant devices.  A BTIDriver compliant device is
          one which uses Ballard's universal BTIDriver API
          library.



     BTITST32.EXE & BTITST64.EXE

          BTITST32.EXE and BTITST64.EXE perform diagnostic
          tests on devices installed in the computer or over
          a network.  It verifies that the devices are
          properly installed and do not conflict with other
          devices.  It also tests each core on the device
          to verify basic functionality.  To run the
          diagnostic tests, launch the BTITST32 or BTITST64
          program, and click the Run Tests button.

          Test results and other information for each device
          and core can be viewed by clicking on each device
          and core object in the tree window.

          If you need assistance, please call Ballard
          Technology at the number listed at the end of this
          document.




     ASSIGNING CARD NUMBERS

          BTIDriver compliant devices are addressed using
          card numbers assigned by the user.  When a device
          is first installed, a default card number is
          assigned by the system.  You can change the default
          card number in BTITST32.

          Right-click the card object in the tree to display
          the card's context menu.  Select the Change Card
          Number command to display the Change Card Number
          dialog.  Enter the desired card number in the edit
          box.

          If you need assistance, please call Ballard
          Technology at the number listed at the end of this
          document.



     DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN CARDS

          When two of the same type of cards are installed in
          the computer it can be difficult to determine which
          card is which.  The BTITST32 program can set and
          clear the card's LED (if availible) to distinguish
          it from the other cards.  To set/clear the LED,
          right-click on the card object in the left most
          column.  Then select the 'LED' option from the
          pop-up menu.  Repeat this operation for each card
          in your system to uniquely identify each card.
