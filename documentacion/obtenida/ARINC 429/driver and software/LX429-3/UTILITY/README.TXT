          Ballard Technology's 717 Monitor allows you to
          observe the information being received on an ARINC
          717 databus.  You can specify the data you wish to
          observe by selecting a word, subframe, and/or
          superframe. You can also configure the monitor to
          match the speed of the bus being monitored.  Data may
          be recording to a file and then played back.
