     INTRODUCTION

          The L43W32VI.LLB is a LabVIEW library that allows
          LabVIEW applications to operate the LP429-3 ARINC
          429 PCI interface card, or the LC429-3 ARINC 429
          cPCI interface card.  It adds the Lx429-3 API
          functions to the LabVIEW function panel under the
          Instruments Library.  Several examples are included
          in the library file.  If they are modified, care
          should be taken to copy the examples to a separate
          VI file or library prior to making the changes.



     WARNING

          Before using the Lx429-3 LabVIEW driver, verify
          that the drivers for the Lx429-3 are correctly
          installed for your particular operating system.
          Refer to the README.TXT file in the DRIVERS folder
          on this disk.
