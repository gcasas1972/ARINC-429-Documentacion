     INTRODUCTION

          The BTI*.LIB files are the import library files for
          the BTIDriver API.  With these files, users can
          write applications that operate a BTIDriver
          compliant device.

          The Driver API has been tested using the Microsoft
          Visual C++ Compiler Version 6.0 and the Borland C++
          Compiler Version 4.5.



     BTI*BC.LIB

          Applications developed with Borland tools cannot
          use the Microsoft import libraries.  Instead,
          Borland users should use BTI*BC.LIB files.



     CORRECTIONS, WARNINGS, AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

          There is no additional information.
