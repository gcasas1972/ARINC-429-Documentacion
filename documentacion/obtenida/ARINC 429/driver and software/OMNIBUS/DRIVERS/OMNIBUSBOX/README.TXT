     INTRODUCTION

          The OmniBusBox is a device that allows the user to
          communicate with multiple avionics databuses.
          These avionics databus interfaces include
          MIL-STD-1553, ARINC 429, ARINC 717, ARINC 708,
          RS-422, CSDB, and Discrete IO.  The folders listed
          above contain the drivers to install the OmniBusBox
          under Windows.

          Please perform the following steps.

          1.  Go to the <WINDOWS> folder and refer to the
              README file appropriate for your version of
              Windows.  Note that the OmniBusBox can be
              installed as either a USB device, or as an
              Ethernet device.

          2.  Either install the test program as described in
              the README files in the <WINDOWS> folder, or go
              to the <TEST> folder to test the installation of
              the OmniBusBox.

          There are headers and libraries for writing
          applications to operate the OmniBusBox, and example
          programs that exercise the various features of the
          OmniBusBox.  These files are located in a separate
          folder.
