     INTRODUCTION

          The OmniBus PCI is a PCI plug-in card that allows
          the user to communicate with multiple avionics
          databuses.  These avionics databus interfaces
          include MIL-STD-1553, ARINC 429, ARINC 717, ARINC
          708, RS-422, CSDB, and Discrete IO.  The folders
          listed above contain the drivers for installing the
          OmniBus PCI under Windows.

          Please perform the following steps.

          1.  Go to the <WINDOWS> folder to select and
              install the driver files appropriate for your
              operating system.

          2.  Go to the <TEST> folder to test the
              installation of the OmniBus PCI in your
              computer.

          There are headers and libraries for writing
          applications to operate the OmniBus PCI, and
          example programs that exercise the various features
