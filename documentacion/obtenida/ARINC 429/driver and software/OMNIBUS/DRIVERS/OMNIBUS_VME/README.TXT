     INTRODUCTION

          The OmniBusVme is a device that allows the user to
          communicate with multiple avionics databuses.
          These avionics databus interfaces include
          MIL-STD-1553, ARINC 429, ARINC 717, ARINC 708,
          RS-422, CSDB, and Discrete IO.  The folders listed
          above contain the drivers to install the OmniBusVme
          under Windows and Linux.



     WINDOWS INSTALLATION

          Please perform the following steps.

          1.  Go to the <WINDOWS> folder and run the
              installation program SETUP.EXE.  The program
              will install the driver files appropriate for
              your operating system, and install BTITST32.EXE
              to test the hardware.

          2.  Run BTITST32.EXE from the desktop icon to test
              the installation of the OmniBusVme in your
              computer.

          There are headers and libraries for writing
          applications to operate the OmniBusVme, and example
          programs that exercise the various features of the
          OmniBusVme.  These files are located in a separate
          folder.



     LINUX INSTALLATION

          To install and operate the OmniBusVme under Linux,
          refer to the readme file in the <LINUX> folder.



     CORRECTIONS, WARNINGS, AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
