     INTRODUCTION

          The L13W32VI.LLB is a LabVIEW library that allows
          LabVIEW applications to operate the LP1553-3
          MIL-STD-1553 PCI interface card, or the LC1555-3
          MIL-STD-1553 cPCI interface card.  It adds the
          Lx1553-3 API functions to the LabVIEW function
          panel under the Instruments Library.  Several
          examples are included in the library file.  If they
          are modified, care should be taken to copy the
          examples to a separate VI file or library prior to
          making the changes.



     WARNING

          Before using the Lx1553-3 LabVIEW driver, verify
          that the drivers for the Lx1553-3 are correctly
          installed for your particular operating system.
          Refer to the README.TXT file in the DRIVERS folder
          on this disk.
